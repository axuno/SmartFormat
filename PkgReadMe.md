### What is *SmartFormat*?

*SmartFormat* is a lightweight text templating library written in C#.

It can format various data sources into a string with a minimal, intuitive syntax similar to *string.Format*. All formatting takes place at runtime.

*SmartFormat* uses extensions to provide named placeholders, localization, pluralization, gender conjugation, as well as list and time formatting. Formatting extensions can be nested.

Custom source or formatter extensions can be added easily using simple interfaces.
